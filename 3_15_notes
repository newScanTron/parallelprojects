parallel alg. does m opts in time t (t steps, theoretically)
On p processors, how many steps are required (t sub p)
let n sub i = # of operations at step i
time for step i : ceil(ni/p)
overall time : sum of ceil(ni/p) from i = 0 to t <= (ni +p-1)/p
= sum of i 1 to t ((ni-1)/p+p/p) = t + sum (ni-1)/p
overall time = t + (m-t)/p ~= t + m/p;
