parallel alg. does m opts in time t (t steps, theoretically)
On p processors, how many steps are required (t sub p)
let n sub i = # of operations at step i
time for step i : ceil(ni/p)
overall time : sum of ceil(ni/p) from i = 0 to t <= (ni +p-1)/p
= sum of i 1 to t ((ni-1)/p+p/p) = t + sum (ni-1)/p
overall time = t + (m-t)/p ~= t + m/p;

ranking complexity of both O(n)

to change something to from scatter to gather almost always requires preprocessing
and will depend on the data if its worth your while.  


4/ 21 notes

each letter is a tw0 byte part of the vector

then mask for each type repetes 00 for A 01 or C and so on.

then how many 1 in the array are how many A  using Xor

then mm_xo_si128,

shift right mm_srli_si128;
or mm_srli_si128;

sub mm_subs_epi8;
